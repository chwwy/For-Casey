[2026-02-20T04:01:52.832Z] USER (cchwy): Usually if I took a fat nap then I wouldn't be able to sleep during the night. But after taking Xanax I actually fell asleep just fine. So, adequate amount of sleep last night, but I'm still oddly tired now. Like really tired but mostly fatigue-like not sleepy
