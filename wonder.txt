I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

And all the lights that light the way are blinding

But I don't know how

You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

[Outro]
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
